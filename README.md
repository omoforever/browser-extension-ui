# Browser Extensions Manager UI

This project is a responsive UI for managing browser extensions. It includes features such as filtering by active status and switching color themes.

## What I built

- Rendered the extension data dynamically from the provided `data.json` file.
- Implemented toggling of extensions between active and inactive states.
- Added filtering functionality to display active or inactive extensions based on user selection.
- Created a color theme selector to switch between available themes.
- Ensured the UI matches the provided design for both mobile and desktop screens.
- Added hover, focus, and active states for interactive elements for better accessibility and UX.
- Used semantic HTML and structured CSS for maintainability and scalability.
- Followed a mobile-first approach to styling and responsive layout.

## What I learned

- Handling dynamic data rendering and state management with vanilla JavaScript.
- Managing user interactions like toggles, filters, and deletions without a framework.
- Implementing responsive design that adapts smoothly across different screen sizes.
- Enhancing accessibility through proper focus and hover states.
- Working with CSS variables and custom properties to implement theme switching.

## Tools and technologies used
